This is a tutorial that I followed which taught me the introduction to Kotlin Deep Learning.

Image Classification:

Introduction to image classification.
Description of the Fashion-MNIST dataset and its categories.
Mapping labels to classes using string-to-number encoding.
Building a Neural Network:

Definition of a neural network structure using Kotlin DL.
Explanation of layers, including Flatten and Dense layers.
Specifying input dimensions and the number of neurons in each Dense layer.
Compiling a Neural Network:

Compilation of the neural network with details on optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
Explanation of Adam optimizer, Softmax Crossentropy with logits loss function, and accuracy metric.
Printing the summary of the neural network's architecture.
Training a Model:

Preprocessing of data, including splitting into training and test sets.
Training the model using the fit() method with epochs and batch size.
Evaluation of the model's accuracy on the test set.
Saving the trained model for future use.
Loading Trained Model for Inference:

Loading a saved model.
Reshaping input images.
Using the model for inference to make predictions on new data.
